/**
 * Audit R3-#1: extracted from app/api/jobs/[jobId]/invoice-pdf/route.ts so the
 * server action `generateInvoicePDF` can call the renderer directly instead
 * of doing an HTTP self-fetch.
 *
 * The previous implementation in invoicing.ts:
 *   const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/jobs/${jobId}/invoice-pdf`, {
 *     headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}` },
 *   })
 *
 * ...always returned 401 because the route authenticates via Supabase session
 * cookies (`getUserWithCompany`) and a server-side `fetch()` does not forward
 * the user's cookies. The catch in `sendInvoiceWithPDF` swallowed the error
 * and the customer received the invoice email with `pdfIncluded: false`.
 * Every "Send Invoice" click in the UI was silently shipping a PDF-less
 * email since this route was added.
 *
 * This helper takes a PRE-VALIDATED companyId — it never calls
 * `getUserWithCompany`. Both the API route and the server action authenticate
 * in their own context first, then hand off the verified companyId here.

// Audit R4-#19: bumped from 24h to 30d. Invoice PDFs are embedded in the
// customer-facing email as a clickable link. At 24h, any customer who opens
// the email on day 2 hits a 403 on the PDF. The portal resigns URLs on
// read, but the PDF link in the email is dead. 30d matches the typical
// invoice payment-attention window and keeps the email functional.
//
// Security note: the exposure model is unchanged. The email ALREADY carries
// a link to the PDF; whoever had access to the email at hour 0 can download
// it. Extending from 24h to 30d doesn't open any new access path — it just
// stops the legitimate recipient from hitting a dead link. For estimate
// signing (where the PDF is consumed within minutes of generation), 24h
// is still the right TTL — that's in lib/actions/signature.ts, not here.
